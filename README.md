## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

1. I used the variable let to have the max at 100. Then I used if else statements to order the letters with the correct grade numbers.



## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

1. I used function and in function I used const variable to show the limit was 70 and 
 I used another const variable to show the rate which was 5 km/s. Then I returned and put "Ok" only if the speed gets under than 70. I then used the let varible to show that if the driver goes above the speed limit they should receive one demerit point.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)


1. I used html for this challenge. I used meta tag to include the data, name and content. Net salary was used as a title in the title tag. I then used the script tag which includes all the var variables with the prompt. I used the gross salary mulitply by 0.2 then to be subtracted by the tax to get the proper Net income and Tax Deduction.

# Installation
